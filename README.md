# MTH522

This project deals with “clustering” data into disjoint sets where data in any one set is more “similar” (in some specified sense) to other data in that set than it is to data in other sets.

Clustering is an example of unsupervised learning.
In this project we will deal only with k-means clustering, .

Data
For this project on k-means clustering there are 2 data sets (downloadable as .csv files):

1.Locations of political violence in India, 1/1/2016 through 1/1/2024.
2.Locations of police shootings in the continental United States.

Calculating Distance given latitude and longitude
Geopy can calculate geodesic distance between two points using the geodesic distance or the great-circle distance, with a default of the geodesic distance available as the function geopy.distance.distance.
